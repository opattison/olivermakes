**Read about [my process for building this site](https://olivermak.es/2014/12/oliver-pattison/).**

Not interested in the code? **Take a look at [the pattern library](https://olivermak.es/patterns/).**

## Goals

- Build a personal website as an archive for my creative output.
- Experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using design patterns that I have not implemented before.
- Self-built: design and implement as much as possible by myself.
- Showcase my work for others.
- Improve at building advanced static sites with Jekyll.

## Principles

- Future-friendly
- Focused on content
- Economical, high performance design
- Progressively enhanced
- Flexible in layout and form
- Respectful of users and their devices
- Usable and accessible
- Empathetic in content, design and tone

## Implementation

- Building: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [npm scripting](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) for optimizing SCSS, JS and SVG assets and speeding up my process
- Archive generation: [Jekyll Archives](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives) gem
- Hosting: Amazon [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [imgix](https://www.imgix.com) for hosting; [AWS ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) for TLS (HTTPS) certificate
- Deploying: [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website), via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
- Version control: GitHub
- Typography: [Adobe Typekit](https://typekit.com/colophons/hro5wuc) â€“ 300, 400 and 500 weights of [the Ratio typeface](http://cargocollective.com/pstype/Ratio) and system monospace fonts (Menlo or Consolas if available)
- Layout: custom [`flexbox`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-css-flexbox-1-20160301/) CSS
- Responsive images: [`srcset`](https://responsiveimages.org), processed and optimized with [imgix](https://www.imgix.com/)
- Maps: [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- No templates, frameworks or boilerplate
- A minimum of front-end JavaScript
